biblatex (1.4c-1) unstable; urgency=low

  With versions 1.0 and higher, compatibility to the ucs package isn't
  provided anymore. If you're using utf8x in your preamble, you may encounter
  strange behaviour and even breakage when compiling your documents. Thus,
  relying on utf8x isn't an option. See this thread [0] for more information
  regarding encoding issues in biblatex.
