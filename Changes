       * Fixed biblatex bug tracker ticket #3399744
       * Fixed bug tracker ticket #3402114

       * Re-factored recode module with XML data and XSL->HTML transform doc
0.9.5  18-08-2011
       * Fixed auto-bblsafechars bug
       * refactored explicit "and others" in bibtex data sources
       * Fixed issue with sorting=none and \nocite{*}
0.9.4  30-07-2011
       * Added support for "SORTSHORTHAND" field
       * New "map" option to allow user field/entry type mapping (aliasing) in
         addition to .dcf settings
       * Made the relevant places depend on max/min{alpha,bib}names instead of
         just max/minnames
       * Bug fixes to bblsafechars
       * Implemented user-customisable labelalpha (not yet in biblatex)
       * Implemented per-name hashes
0.9.3  05-06-2011
       * New mininit and minfull uniquename options
       * New minyear uniquelist option
       * Major revamp of uniqueness code
       * Moved to new external process calling module because IPC::Run
         doesn't work on Windows in packed binaries (kpsewhich was
         returning nothing).
0.9.2  09-05-2011
       * Some internal changes for perl 5.14
       * Bug fixes for uniquelist processing
0.9.1  29-04-2011
       * Made temp files all use a global temp dir.
       * Moved temp .utf8 conversions to temp dir so biber works using
         .bib files which are in non-writable locations.
       * Added back an info log message about finding data sources (Lyx compat)
0.9    29-03-2011
       * No longer auto-escapes any TeX markup in bibtex data sources. This
         is fraught with danger and is a mess. Best not to do it at all.
       * Supports biblatex \bibnamedelimi macro
       * Implementation of uniquename and uniquelist options for biblatex 1.4+
0.8.4  19-03-2011
       * Bug fixes (wrong escaping of "[", "_" and "]" in .bbl)
0.8.3  14-03-2011
       * Biber now in TexLive
       * Added several new binary builds
       * All name part and element formatting is now abstracted into macros
         so that it can be controlled via biblatex.
       * Much more documentation on binary builds for packagers
       * Bug fixes
0.8.2  14-02-2011
       * Bug fixes
0.8.1  12-02-2011
       * Small bug with default bibtex month macro support
       * Made remote file support a little more robust (URI return codes)
0.8    11-02-2011
       * Forces biblatex format for month field
       * Added support for remote data sources
       * Added experimental support for RIS data sources
       * Took out -a and -d flags. These are no longer very useful as the increasingly
         sophisticated biblatex options cannot be set on the command line
         anyway and so these flags are less and less relevant
       * New inheritance model in sync with biblatex defaults
       * Bug fixes
0.7.4  05-02-2011
       * Fix for mincrossrefs leaking across sections (biblatex SF bug #3173032)
0.7.3  03-02-2011
       * Performance tuning for sorting
       * Text::BibTeX 0.51 for increased macro stack space

       * Merged LaTeX::Decode into Biber::LaTeX::Recode and added encoding
         to deal with inputenc's limitations for PDFLaTeX users
       * new options for forcing/tuning UTF-8 -> LaTeX macro conversion
       * Bug fixes
0.7.2  08-01-2011

       * Added "x-ascii" encoding alias for "ascii" to deal with inputenx ascii.
       * Bug fixes
0.7    05-01-2011
       * Completely re-written sorting routine using Schwartzian transform
         for real multi-field support and per-field sorting settings.
       * Bug fixes
0.6.9  (dev beta)
       * Bug fixes

       * Misc bug fixes
0.6.2  (dev beta)
       * Internal cleanup of structure code
       * Misc bug fixes
0.6.1  (dev beta)
       * More comprehensive structural checks on allowed entrytypes/fields
         and field combinations/formats
       * Added option validate_structure to turn on structural checks
       * Renamed option validate -> validate_control
       * Renamed option output-directory -> output_directory
       * Added labelname and labelyear as possible sort specifications
       * Misc bug fixes
0.6    20-11-2010
       * First non-beta release
       * More abstracted and extensible crossref inheritance model
       * U::C dependency to 0.67
       * sortcase and sortupper options now take same argument forms as in biblatex
       * Misc bug fixes
0.5.7  09-10-2010
       * Misc bug fixes
0.5.6  04-10-2010
       * Latex character macro decoding is now better defined in the whole
         (re)encoding workflow.
       * "inputenc" option is now "bblencoding"
       * "locale" option is now "sortlocale"
       * New option "sortupper"
       * Unicode::Collate sorting is now default as version 0.61 of this
         has XS module and CLDR tailoring.
       * Added binary dist build scripts
       * Removed bundled Module::Build as there are some conflicts with
         later versions. This is less of a problem anyway because the
         binary build makes it less necessary to make builds easy on perl<5.10
       * Misc bug fixes
0.5.5   29-08-2010
       * Biber::BibTeX moved to Biber::Input::BibTeX. If upgrading, please remove
         your installed <perl lib>/Biber/BibTeX.pm, just to be tidy
       * New aliases for EPRINT classes and types implemented (see BibLaTeX docs).
       * Biber now resolves XREFs as well as CROSSREFs so one less LaTeX pass is needed
       * Allows UTF-8 citekeys. Requires Text::BibTeX >= 0.46 and a fully UTF-8
         aware TeX macro package (e.g. XeTeX or LuaLaTeX). Normal LaTeX with \inputenc
         will not work because the UTF-8 it uses is incomplete, macro based and not native.
       * RecDescent parser is no longer supported or included. If upgrading, please remove
         your installed <perl lib>/Biber/BibTeX directory, just to be tidy
       * Now requires LaTeX::Decode >= 0.03
       * Stricter version dependency for Text::BibTeX. Older than 0.42 is
         rather useless for complex names.
       * Re-factored and enhanced auto-re-encoding of .bib/.bbl. With biblatex
         0.9c, Biber handles all reencoding.
       * Misc bug fixes
0.5.4   04-08-2010
       * Case-sensitive sorting option
       * Multi-section support. Only one biber pass needed to process all
         bib sections using extended biblatex 0.9b .bbl format.
       * .aux file is no longer used by biber - all information is passed
         in .bcf file.
       * Misc bug fixes
       * LaTeX::Decode is now a separate CPAN module and is no longer included
0.5.3  19-03-2010
       * Changed semantics of --outfile and --output-directory. --outfile
         is now relative to --output-directory. If --outfile is absolute, it
         is stripped to the filename and the path discarded. Absolute .aux
         paths are stripped to filename for appending to --output-directory.
       * Updated PRD to use new encoding option names. Now works with -e.
       * sortlos was not settable to use bib sort order
       * With Text::BibTeX >= 0.42, will do all name/initials generation with btparse
         library.
       * Abstracted BBL output into Biber::Output class for better re-use and potential
         for output formats other than .bbl.
       * Synced uniquename .bcf values with change in biblatex 0.9a
0.5.2   04-03-2010
       * Locale fixes
       * Uniquename fixed to match BibLaTeX option values
       * Improved error message for malformed names
       * Fixed config file problems under windows and also added option to ignore config file
       * Bug with conflicting case between citations and bib entries
       * Moved pure perl parsename to PRD.pm
       * Re-write of name parsing to use Text::BibTeX::Name by default
       * Fields which can be null are explicitly flagged
       * Add THANKS file
       * Die early when biber is called without argument
       * Fixed Mac config path error
       * .bib parse continues after certain errors
       * regularised collate options processing
       * field nameaddon was missing from Biber::Constants
       * Improved warning message for missing backend=biber
       * SF bug 2952347 fix (empty date range end)
       * uniquename counter was being provided incorrectly
0.5.1   15.02.2010
        * Remove support for legacy control files (\jobname-blx.bib):
          Biber now only reads .bcf files written by biblatex with the 
          option "backend=biber".
        * Improved handling of "uniquename" and "namehash".
        * Don't apply latexescape in bbl output, as it breaks math formatting.

0.5     13.02.2010
        * Supports all changes introduced by biblatex 0.9
        * Moved all parts relating to the experimental BibLaTeXML format to the
          "biblatexml" branch on the git repo
        * Communication between biblatex and Biber can be done through a
          XML-based config file (extension .bcf): this is enabled with the
          experimental biblatex option "backend=biber"
        * Biber can now be customized with a configuration file
        * Considerable refactoring and cleanup of the code
        * Further enhancements to the test suite
        * Improved logging mechanism
        * More robust parsing of personal names
        * Ignore certain prefixes and diacritics in sort strings, for
          instance ʿAlī is sorted under A, and al-Hasan under H. This can
          be customized in the configuration file (biber.conf).
        * New command-line option --output-directory (like TeX)
        * Many, many bugfixes :)
        (See the output of "git log" for all details...)

0.4.3   23.07.2009
        * With biblatex option "backend=biber" and biber option --v2
          the new experimental control file \jobname.bcf is used,
          which brings in many new features, such as per-entrytype
          settings.
        * More sophisticated/customizable sorting mechanism
        * More extensive test suite
        * Improved BibLaTeXML schema
        * improved handling of BibLaTeXML (enable nested children,
          formatting elements, nosort elements)
        * Do not apply latexescape() by default on xml strings
        * Skip title handling in BibLaTeXML when not existing
        * Ignore maxline, add option wraplines
        * Built-in sort is now default (option --fastsort)
        * Sorting with Unicode::Collate is possible with option --collate
        * Make tests succeed w/o Parse::RD and Regexp::Common
        * Don't output date and urldate in the bbl
        * Add missing fields "date" "urldate" "organization" "annotator"
          "foreword" and "eventtitle"
        * Use Data::Dump instead of Data::Dumper for debugging
        * Fields "library" and "remarks" are now skipped
        * Bugfix for aliases (e.g. address, school)
        * Bugfix: process urldate to get urlyear,urlmonth,urlday
        * Remove illegal value shorttranslator from labelname option
        * Changed biberdebug option to debug
        * Changed option inputencoding to bibencoding

0.4.2   25.04.2009
        * New option --inputencoding to handle 8-bit encoded bib files
        * $BIBINPUT environment is now searched
        * Improved parsing of personal names

        * Fixed handling of @preamble; multiple preambles are allowed
        * Warnings and errors behave more like BibTeX
        * Alias fields are automatically converted (e.g. address -> location)
        * Take care of "phdthesis" and "mathesis" types
        * Cite keys of bib files are now case-insensitive
        * Default Unicode collation now uses the table "latinkeys.txt"
          (this is much faster than "allkeys.txt" which contains rules for
          all Unicode glyphs)
        * Unicode::Collate parameters can be passed as a command-line option
        * Faster sorting (with option -f) is also possible for specific
          locales given with option --locale (this is OS-dependent however)
        * PRD grammar is now precompiled
        * bbl output is now wrapped acc to maxline option
        * Empty fields are no longer printed in the bbl
        * Sorting is much improved.
        * Use sortstring separators 0 1 2 like biblatex.bst
        * Handle truncation of name lists acc to minnames/maxnames
        * bib2biblatexml has been improved
        * Windows version of Text::BibTeX provided as ppm.
        * Many more bugfixes!
